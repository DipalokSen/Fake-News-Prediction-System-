# Fake-News-Prediction-System-
This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake using machine learning models. This notebook walks through the data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, training, and evaluation phases to achieve effective fake news classification.

# Project Structure
### Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Loads the dataset and preprocesses text by cleaning, tokenizing, and removing stop words.
### Feature Engineering:
Uses techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
### Model Training:
Implements multiple machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to classify news articles.
Includes cross-validation to improve model performance.
### Evaluation:
Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best-performing classifier.
### How to Use
Open the Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Run each cell sequentially to load data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate results.
Results and Insights
The notebook concludes with a comparison of model performances, helping you select the most effective approach for fake news detection based on your data
